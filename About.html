        <p> I’m a Software Engineer with a passion for solving real world problems and creating innovative
            solutions. I have recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Technology and
            Software Development from Valencia College in Orlando Florida. At Valencia, I built a strong
            foundation in Object oriented programming and software engineering. I’ve gained hands-on experience
            with Java, C++, and Python through projects like a Data Management System where a user can perform CRUD
            operations on data, and a Data pipeline to automate ETL actions using Python and Apache Airflow.
            I’m excited for the future of Software development and applying my skills to new challenges. </p>

        <p> Alongside my technical skills, I’ve had the chance to develop strong problem-solving and collaboration
            abilities through my work at Walt Disney World and Universal Studios Florida. In my role as a PhotoPass
            Photographer at Disney, I worked closely with different teams to enhance the guest experience by developing
            new and exciting photo opportunities. I also used my creative problem-solving skills to implement
            solutions to improve efficiency and guest flow. </p>

        <p> I have experience with object-oriented programming (OOP), software development life cycle (SDLC), building
            graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and working with databases like SQL (MySQL). I’m always looking to expand my
            knowledge in software architecture, Agile development, and cloud technologies. I'm particularly interested
            in building scalable applications and automated systems—environments that focus on innovation and creating
            meaningful technology-driven solutions excite me. </p>
